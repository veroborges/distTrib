=== BUILDING ===
This project uses 'gb', a go build system.

To build this project, type:  gb

To clean, type:  gb -c

=== TESTING ===
There are two test programs.  One uses the command-line client,
which is built as bin/client.

To use this one, run ./testme.sh
It runs a basic set of tests and assumes that your program
is running on port 9009.  It's kind of fragile for now.

The tests in server/server_test.go are more robust, but
we're still in the process of adding more tests to them.
Please check the announcements for updates to the tests.

To run the server tests:  gb -t


=== HANDING IN ===
Please remember to clean your directory before handing it in,
and remove server.log
